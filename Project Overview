PROJECT TITLE : ANTI SPOOFING AND ANTI SPAM DETECTION

APP NAME : SpamBlocker OR SafeDial.

QUOTES: "In the battle against spam and spoofing, knowledge is your greatest weapon. Equip yourself with our advanced detection system."
		OR
"Trust is built on transparency. Our system ensures that every call you receive is verified and secure."

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN :

PHASE 1 : REQUIREMENTS GATHERING.
	Activities : 
		*Surveys and Questionnaires: Distribute surveys to a broader audience to collect quantitative data on user experiences with spam calls and their desired features in an application.
	
		*Define Scope: Clearly outline the features and functionalities that will be included in the project, as well as any limitations or exclusions.
	
PHASE 2 : DESIGN.
	To create a blueprint for the application, including architecture, user-interface, and database schema.
	
	Activities:

    		*Architecture Design: Define the overall architecture of the application, including the interaction between the frontend (React Native) and backend (Node.js), as well as the database (MySQL).
    
		*User Interface (UI) Design: This includes designing screens for user registration, call management, spam reporting, and whitelisting.
	
		*Database Schema Design: Define the structure of the database, including tables/collections for users, whitelists, spam scores, and call logs. Specify the relationships between different entities.
	
		*API Design: Outline the RESTful API endpoints that will be used for communication between the frontend and backend, including request/response formats.
	
PHASE 3 : DEVELOPMENT
	
	Activities : Backend Development.
		*Set up a Node.js server using Express.
		*Implement user registration and authentication, including TOTP generation OR Fingerprint  and verification.
		*Create API endpoints for functionalities such as reporting spam, whitelisting numbers, and retrieving user data.
		Implement the spam scoring algorithm based on whitelisting and spam reports.
		: Frontend Development.
		*Develop the React Native application, creating components for user registration, call management, and spam reporting.
		*Integrate TOTP scanning and input functionality using libraries like react-native-qrcode-scanner.
		*ensure Application is Responsive and User-frindly
		
		
PHASE 4 : TESTING
	 To ensure that the application is functional, secure, and user-friendly.
	 
	Activities : 
		*Integration Testing: Test the interaction between different components of the application, such as the frontend and backend, to ensure they communicate correctly.
		
		*User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Involve real users in testing the application to gather feedback on usability and functionality. Make adjustments based on their input.

PHASE 5 : DEPLOYMENT
	
	Activities : 
		*Backend Deployment:  Deploy the Node.js server on a cloud service (e.g., AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean) and ensure it is properly configured for production.
		*Frontend Deployment: Publish the React Native application on app stores (Google Play Store and Apple App Store) after thorough testing and compliance with their guidelines.
		*Database Deploymant: Set up the database in a cloud environment, ensuring it is secure and accessible by the backend.
		*Monitoring Setup: Implement monitoring tools to track application performance, user engagement, and error reporting, Logging.
		
PHASE 6 : MAINTENANCE.
	
	Activities : 
		
		*User Support: Provide support channels for users to report issues, ask questions, and provide feedback.
		*Regular Updates: Release updates to fix bugs, improve performance, and add new features based on user feedback and changing requirements.
		*Performance Monitoring: Continuously monitor application performance and user engagement metrics to identify areas for improvement.
